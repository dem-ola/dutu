# dutu
the little todo app for big plans

Dutu is a lightweight todo browser app written in React and native Javascript. Todo items are created in a straightforward  GUI and saved to a JSON file stored in the browser's local storage.

Installation
1. Clone the repository OR
    
   If you're feeling brave you can zip all the files using 
http://github.com/dem-ola/dutu//zipball/master/ and then rename or move the folder if you want.

2. IMPORTANT: Disable Cross-Origin restrictions\
   In Safari you do this in the Develop menu

3. Open the dutu.html file in the folder from your browser.\
   The first time you open this you should have an Input box and two buttons: Add New and Clear List

Use\
The input box - type in new todo items\
Add New - click to create and add a new item\
Clear List - this will delete all items after a warning

Each todo item:\
Edit - Click to edit item text\
Delete - this will delete the todo item after a warning\
Done checkbox - click to indicate item done; will add a 'finished' date (default: now) to the item row\
add. date - date item created\
fin. date - date item completed\
number d - days since added or completed if finsished 

There's no app Save button: everything is saved as you go along


Future\
I have more ideas for Dutu and will add to it over time.
